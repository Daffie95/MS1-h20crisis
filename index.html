						<h1 class="display-4 jombotron-header">What Is Happening?
						</h1>
						<p class="lead">
							In 2000, almost 1.7bn were living in water scarce areas. As of right
							now
							(2020), that number has skyrocketed to 2.3bn. And in 2030, it is expected to
							be 2.7bn.
							Why is this happening?
						</p>
						<p>
							Water scarcity is a growing issue that is rapidly increasing on every continent on
							earth,
							but some
							locations are far more exposed to this issue. We see these issues growing much
							faster in
							countries closer to the equator, increased temperatures and extensive periods of
							drought
							contributes to the matter. A growing number of regions are reporting that they are
							reaching
							the limits for sustainable delivery of water. Water could be scarce due to physical
							shortage, mostly refered to as "Physical Water Scarcity". Physical scarcity is a
							result of a
							population that grows immensly every day. Water scarcity can also be caused by a
							lack of
							infrastructure, or a constitutional neglect that results in an inability to ensure a
							regular
							supply, this is known as "Economical Water Scarcity". Many regions that suffer from
							the
							"Economical" version of water scarcity is rapidly growing urban areas where
							neighbouring
							water resources are put under heavy pressure. The crisis is not a global event, as
							of right
							now. But individual countries are suffering greatly, and need to tackle the problems
							that
							the water scarcity puts on the regions. Changes in how available water is to the public will
							also heavely affect general health and reduce food quality. According to <a
								href="https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/27b53d18-6069-45f7-a1bd-d5a48bc80322/downloads/1c2meuvon_105010.pdf"
								alt="#">GWI</a>, roughly 700 million people all
							over the world may be displaced due to water scarcity by 2030.
							<br>
							<br>
                            Statistics show that the worlds water use has grown at twice the rate of the population increase over the world.
                            The fact that over 2 billion people today live in constant water stress today,
                            and with increasing heavy load on our environment makes us and our partners believe that these numbers only will rise in the future.
                            In many countries around the world, women and girls have the primary responsibility to manage the household water supply. Firstly, this is in many cases a time-consuming and heavy duty,
                            in stead of working or aquiring education. Secondly, without freshwater that is safe to consume and to maintain adequate hygine at home, the rate of pregnancy-failure will increase, alongside water carried diseases.

							<h1 class="display-4 jombotron-header" id="causes">Why is this happening?
							</h1>
							<p class="lead">
								There are multiple reasons and then some to why water is becoming a scarce resource on
								our planet. Our earth contains an immense ammount of water, however, the oceans are to
								the 99nth percentile consisting of saltwater, makingit it undrinkable. And the vast
								majority of fresh water is locked inside glaciers, making water a much more rare
								resource then one might think.
							</p>
							<p>
								Water being scarce across the global has already proven to create political instability
								and even trigger refugee dynamics. With temperatures rising to more extreme levels,
								weather becomes less predictable, an exaple is many of the countries that relies on
								heavy rainfall, snowmelt, groundwater or rivers may expect severe decline in water
								quality due to the rising temperatures.
								<br>
								<br>
                                Overexploitation of natural resources is a major jeopardization on our natural ecosystems in lakes, rivers and other aquatic sectors.
                                This will and have had dire consequences on the reliability and sustainablity of water supplies in adjecent areas.
                                As mentioned above, the "Economical Water Scarcity" may afflict politicial standings in countries that share water resources.
                                Imagine if you are living on one side of a big fresh water river, and recently,
                                the country on the other side built a big factory needing water to cool their turbines, as well as the pollution eventually rendering the water unusable for individuals.
                                Once the entire lake is depleted, the risk now is that saltwater intrusion from coastal areas bringing in toxins as arsenic and fluoride, killing the nearby crops.
                                While the conflicts play a part in the issue, <a
									href="http://www.unece.org/env/water/">according to UNECE</a> only 37 incidents of
								acute conflict over water areas have been reported since 1948,
								and almost 300 agreements were negotiated and signed to cover these waters.
								<br>
								<br>
Finaces is a problem in this as well. The <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6">UN SDG6</a>
								wich is to reach everyone with "W.A.S.H" (water, sanitation and hygiene) by 2030 is
								ambitious, however, this is a crucial goal to eradicate extreme poverty.
								But 80% of the countries that signed on for the SDG6 agreement reports insufficient
								financing towards the goal.
								The main source of finance towards this project comes from taxing individuals and
								businesses, tariffs paid by households and governments, and the provision of goodwill.
								And there are significant gaps in between actually financing, governance and policies
								and the aspiration to make W.A.S.H's reach global reality. It is projected that even
								without considering operational and maintenance costs, the financial aid needs to be
								tripled to achive the goal.
