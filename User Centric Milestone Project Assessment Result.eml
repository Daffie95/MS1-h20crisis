Hi Patrik,

The assessment of your User Centric Milestone Project has just been
completed.

The links you submitted were:

   - Deployed project <https://daffie95.github.io/MS1-h20crisis/>
   - Source code
   <https://github.com/Code-Institute-Submissions/MS1-h20crisis>

You have received the following textual feedback from the assessor for
*Pass* Criteria:

Please find the detailed mapping of criteria here.
<https://codeinstitute.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/fullstack/03-user-centric-front-end-development/Assessment+Guidelines+CM.pdf>

*LO1 Design a front-end web application based on the principles of user
experience design, accessibility and responsive design:*
Criterion Meets Criterion Reason
1.1 Yes Intuitive navigation options on the website
1.2 Yes Good contrast throughout allowing content to take center stage on
the screen
1.3 Yes Intuitive user experience
1.4 Yes Simple and Elegant
1.5 Yes All graphics are consistent in size, resolution and layout
1.6 Yes Videos are handled correctly and in user control
Additional The structure of the layout is satisfactory. Navigation links
sustain a flow. Color contrast possesses a passing ratio and can hinder the
visually impaired at some point. *LO2 Develop and implement a static Front
End web application using HTML and CSS.*
Criterion Meets Criterion Reason
2.1 Yes Information prioritizes across multiple (>3) pages and highlights
the core CTA
2.2 Yes Passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues
2.3 Yes Passes through the official (W3C) validator with no issues
2.4 Yes Consistent images displayed throughout the website
2.5 Yes All test social links in place
2.6 Yes Effective use of bootstrap and media queries, All content reflows
well to fit on all tested media screens
2.7 Yes Evidence of NAV SECTION and FOOTER elements throughout site
2.8 Yes All content reflects and clarifies the site's purpose
2.9 Yes Strategically placed navigation is clear in its intention
Additional The HTML and CSS code is clean and passes the validator.
Navigation is easy and straight forward. However, the header tag is
recommended while practicing semantic markup. *LO3 Maximize future
maintainability through documentation, code structure and organization.*
Criterion Meets Criterion Reason
3.1 Yes Missing relevant steps or included but not described in detail
3.2 Yes Wireframes present
3.3 Yes Readme consists of credits to some but not all external resources
3.4 Yes Clear separation between the code sections is present
3.5 Yes Code comments missing for different sections
3.6 Yes CSS links placed appropriately
3.7 Yes Code formatting is used, but not on all files
3.8 Yes Meets stated criterion
3.9 Yes Assets and child directories present
Additional This aspect is just given a pass because some efforts are given
to fulfill the requirement. Though the readme file is formatted and
detailed, it lacks in discussing the deployment phase. Code commenting is
not overall followed, and code formatting is not covered throughout the
project. *LO4 Use version control software to maintain, upload and share
code with other developers.*
Criterion Meets Criterion Reason
4.1 Yes Audit trail of Git commits suggests educated usage of version
control
4.2 Yes Descriptive commit messages present
4.3 Yes Markdown used to create a well-structured README and passes
Grammarly criteria
Additional Git Version Control is used fairly. Commits are extensive and
descriptive. However, the commit messages need to be more specific in
readme updates. Effective formatting is executed in the readme file. *LO5
Test and deploy a Front End web application to a Cloud platform.*
Criterion Meets Criterion Reason
5.1 Yes All user stories tested and documented
5.2 Yes Separate file dedicated to testing documentation
5.3 Yes Matches content up to submitted commit
5.4 Yes Commented-out code is not present in submitted version
5.5 Yes All links return status code 200
Additional Though the readme file presents a clear rationale and includes
detailed testing, the deployment steps are not included. However, there are
no broken links and uncommented code. The deployed version is the same as
the remote.

You have received the following textual feedback from the assessor for
*Merit* Criteria:
*Merit Criteria Comments: *
Criterion Meets Criterion Reason
1.1 No Structure, layout, navigation all lends to a site whose purpose is
clear from the outset However there is one major area of improvement in
this where the What is Happening?, and Why is it Happening? elements are
completely obscured y the background.
2.1 Yes The purpose is clear from the outset. Information hierarchy is
supported by consistent imagery and text
2.2 Yes Site meets all stated user stories
3.1 No Code lacks in comments and indentation at various points
4.1 Yes Extensive commit history is evidence of use of best practices
5.1 No Deployment steps missing in the readme, also Testing is not linked
to in the Readme though a separate document is present.
5.4 Yes Bugs and their fixes documented
5.5 No Development cycle not fully documented
Additional There are Lacks in color contrast, the readme file is
suboptimally arranged with the table of contents, and the content not
matching up perfectly and lacks detail in sections like deployment, which
does not lead the project to both merit and distinction.

*Additional comments (if any) for Overall Feedback : * The structure of the
layout is satisfactory. Color contrast possesses a passing ratio and can
hinder the visually impaired at some point. Navigation is easy and straight
forward. However, the header tag is recommended while practicing semantic
markup. Though the readme file is formatted and detailed, it lacks in
discussing the deployment phase. Commits are extensive and descriptive.
However, the commit messages need to be more specific in readme updates.
Lacking robust code and deployment steps restrict the project from
achieving a higher grade.

You have achieved a *PASS* Grade for this Assessment. Any criterion that
wasn't fulfilled as a part of Merit grade are marked as No in above
section. Please note that the feedback you have received is personal to you
and is considered private so is not to be shared.

Thank you,
The Code Institute Assessment Team.

<p><b>Additional comments (if any) for Overall Feedback : </b>
The structure of the layout is satisfactory. Color contrast possesses a pas=
sing ratio and can hinder the visually impaired at some point. Navigation i=
s easy and straight forward. However, the header tag is recommended while p=
racticing semantic markup. Though the readme file is formatted and detailed=
, it lacks in discussing the deployment phase.  Commits are extensive and d=
escriptive. However, the commit messages need to be more specific in readme=
 updates. Lacking robust code and deployment steps restrict the project fro=
m achieving a higher grade.</p>

<p>You have achieved a <b>PASS</b> Grade for this Assessment. Any criterion=
 that wasn&#39;t fulfilled as a part of Merit grade are marked as No in abo=
ve section. Please note that the feedback you have received is personal to =
you and is considered private so is not to be shared.</p>
